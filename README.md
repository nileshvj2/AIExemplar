# AI Exemplar 

This project serves as a proof of concept for Azure OpenAI and other AI functionalities in Azure. The project is not intended to be a production-ready application, but rather a starting point for exploring the Azure AI journey and understanding the capabilities of Azure AI services. The POCs developed through this project will demonstrate the potential of Azure AI and serve as a foundation for potential use cases and projects.
